/**
 * This class is a representation of the json object sent by the WhatsApp webhook.
 * Whenever a trigger event occurs, the WhatsApp Business Platform sees the event and sends a notification to a Webhook URL you have previously specified.
 * You can get two types of notifications:<br>
 * - <b>Received messages</b>: This alert lets you know when you have received a message. These can also be called "inbound notifications" throughout the documentation.<br>
 * - <b>Message status and pricing notifications</b>: This alert lets you know when the status of a message has changed â€”for example, the message has been read or delivered. These can also be called "outbound notifications" throughout the documentation.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/cloud-api/guides/set-up-webhooks">Webhooks Setup Guide</a> to more details.
